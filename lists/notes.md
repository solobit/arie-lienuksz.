Default values, in general, are bad. Sometimes standards and convention require
you to comply, but just as often not. Be creative and dare to experiment when
possible to get a "feel" for the optimized settings (if no guidelines can be
found online) for your given situation.

Security through obscurity only works if you know what you are doing. Take small
steps and build in mnemonics and/or a naming system or convention for yourself
to remember. Key is not to keep hidden for persistent intruder eyes, rather fend
off any standard settings most of the time.

Rebooting means volatile process; consequently, open files (`lsof`), logged in
session users and domains (`utmp`) and network connection data
are gone unless special measures were taken to preserve this data (non-default).
